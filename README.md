# MNIST_Classification_ANN_Maths
MNIST digits Classification using our own Neural network created from scratch (without using Keras/Tensorflow/Pytorch)) 
We will implement an L-layered deep neural network and train it on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset contains scanned images of handwritten digits, along with their correct classification labels (between 0-9).
We will do:
1. Input transformation.
2. Create a NN.
3. Feed Forward.
4. Backpropagation.
5. Weights update.
6. Evaluation.
